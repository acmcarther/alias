alias
=====

because i need short urls for long things

## What is this?
It is a planned small self-hosted service for aliasing urls to shortened, quick urls.

## Goals:

### Required
- Auth
- REST API:
  - Shortend urls     : s.tld/s/c1b31
  - User defined urls : s.tld/nice_file
- Simple frontend

### Nice to have
- Removing urls
- Querying existing urls

## Wheres the stuff?
Theres some stuff in web/, which provides a really basic api.

It currently exists as a barebones web layer on top of redis.

## Wheres the license?
Not here yet buddy
